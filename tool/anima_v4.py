"""anima_v4 — shared runnable harness for HYPOTHESES hypothesis cards.

Deterministic, dependency-free (stdlib only) primitives for the anima-v4 problem.
HYPOTHESES cards reference these functions from their per-hypothesis run scripts
under `state/<hX>/` (shared machinery lives in repo-root `tool/`, per-hypothesis
runs live in `state/`).

Every function is a closed-form public relation — no fitting, no hidden constants
beyond documented defaults. All inputs are explicit so a card's falsifiers can be
evaluated against the returned numbers. Replace the placeholder primitives below
with the domain relations this campaign actually needs.
